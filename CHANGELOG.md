## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate
### Added
* Support for `embedded-hal` version `1.0.0-alpha.10`. To use this you must disable the default features and instead enable the `hal_v1` feature.

### Changed
* Due to dependency updates the MSRV has been updated from 1.60 to 1.62. This should only be relevant if you use the `defmt` feature, but we now only test with 1.62 and not older releases, so it's not guaranteed to work otherwise.
